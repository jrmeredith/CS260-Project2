# CS260-Project2
A continuation of Project 1.  This time using functions.  
  
Project 2 for CS 260 class.  

This is Project 2 for my CS 260 class. It is a letter guessing game called Alphabet Game.  
The computer randomly picks a letter and the player must guess.  
  
This version of the game was written using addtion function techniques (return types, arguments, etc...).
